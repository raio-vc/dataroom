## Introduction

**Raio Data Room** is an open-source web application developed by the [Raio Capital](https://raio.vc) team. It is designed to enable small teams to share investment opportunities, including all required documentation for analysis and due diligence.

The application is built on **[Start UI Web](https://github.com/BearStudio/start-ui-web)** by BearStudio and can be fully deployed on the **Vercel free tier** without additional configuration.

** Only the basic user scaffold is available at the moment.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Duplicate the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file, and update the environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Quick advices for local development**
> - **DON'T update** the **EMAIL_SERVER** variable, because the default value will be used to catch the emails during the development.

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Setup and start the db with docker
```bash
pnpm dk:init
```
> [!NOTE]
> **Don't want to use docker?**
>
> Setup a PostgreSQL database (locally or online) and replace the **DATABASE_URL** environment variable. Then you can run `pnpm db:push` to update your database schema and then run `pnpm db:seed` to seed your database.

## Development

```bash
# Run the database in Docker (if not already started)
pnpm dk:start
# Run the development server
pnpm dev
```

### Emails in development

#### Maildev to catch emails

In development, the emails will not be sent and will be catched by [maildev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev).

The maildev UI is available at [0.0.0.0:1080](http://0.0.0.0:1080).

#### Preview emails

Emails templates are built with `react-email` components in the `src/emails` folder.

You can preview an email template at `http://localhost:4000/devtools/email/{template}` where `{template}` is the name of the template file in the `src/emails/templates` folder.

Example: [Login Code](http://localhost:4000/devtools/email/login-code)

##### Email translation preview

Add the language in the preview url like `http://localhost:4000/devtools/email/{template}/{language}` where `{language}` is the language key (`en`, `fr`, ...)

#### Email props preview

You can add search params to the preview url to pass as props to the template.
`http://localhost:4000/devtools/email/{template}/?{propsName}={propsValue}`

### Storybook

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

### Update theme typing

When adding or updating theme components, component variations, sizes, colors and other theme foundations, you can extend the internal theme typings to provide nice autocomplete.

Just run the following command after updating the theme:

```bash
pnpm theme:generate-typing
```

### Generate custom icons components from svg files

Put the custom svg files into the `src/components/Icons/svg-sources` folder and then run the following command:

```bash
pnpm theme:generate-icons
```

> [!WARNING]
> All svg icons should be svg files prefixed by `icon-` (example: `icon-externel-link`) with **24x24px** size, only **one shape** and **filled with `#000` color** (will be replaced by `currentColor`).


### Update color mode storage key

You can update the storage key used to detect the color mode by updating this constant in the `src/theme/config.ts` file:

```tsx
export const COLOR_MODE_STORAGE_KEY = 'start-ui-color-mode'; // Update the key according to your needs
```

### E2E Tests

E2E tests are setup with Playwright.

```sh
pnpm e2e     # Run tests in headless mode, this is the command executed in CI
pnpm e2e:ui  # Open a UI which allow you to run specific tests and see test execution
```

Tests are written in the `e2e` folder; there is also a `e2e/utils` folder which contains some utils to help writing tests.

## Show hint on development environments

Setup the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_NAME` env variable with the name of the environment.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_NAME="staging"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_EMOJI="ðŸ”¬"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_COLOR_SCHEME="teal"
```

## Translations

### Setup the i18n Ally extension

We recommended using the [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lokalise.i18n-ally) plugin for VS Code for translations management.

Create or edit the `.vscode/settings.json` file with the following settings:

```json
{
  "i18n-ally.localesPaths": [
    "src/locales",
    "node_modules/zod-i18n-map/locales"
  ],
  "i18n-ally.keystyle": "nested",
  "i18n-ally.enabledFrameworks": ["general", "react", "i18next"],
  "i18n-ally.namespace": true,
  "i18n-ally.defaultNamespace": "common",
  "i18n-ally.extract.autoDetect": true,
  "i18n-ally.keysInUse": ["common.languages.*"]
}
```

## Production

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm storybook:build # Optional: Will expose the Storybook at `/storybook`
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### Deploy with Docker

1. Build the Docker image (replace `start-ui-web` with your project name)
```
docker build -t start-ui-web .
```

2. Run the Docker image (replace `start-ui-web` with your project name)
```
docker run -p 80:4000 start-ui-web
```
Application will be exposed on port 80 ([http://localhost](http://localhost))

### Deploy on Vercel
